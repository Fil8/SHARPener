Overview
========

This is a set of tools that have been developed in preparation of the `SHARP survey <https://www.astron.nl/astronomy-group/apertif/science-projects/sharp-search-hi-absorption-apertif/sharp>`_ performed by APERTIF.

The main function of `SHARPener` is to identify the position of all continuum
sources in a continuum image and extract a spectrum from each line of sight of
these sources. The spectra are then plotted.
