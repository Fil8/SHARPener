# SHARPener

This is a set of tools that have been developed in preparation of the SHARP survey [SHARP webpage](
https://www.astron.nl/astronomy-group/apertif/science-projects/sharp-search-hi-absorption-apertif/sharp). 

The main function of `sharpener` is to identify the position of all continuum sources in a continuum image and extract
a spectrum from each line of sight of these sources. 

The spectra are then plotted. 

`sharpener` can be run using a `.yml` parameter file (link to default) as `python sharpener.py <parameter_file.yml>`, or through a `IPython`
notebook. 

The following tutorials can guide you through the different capabilities of `sharpener`.
